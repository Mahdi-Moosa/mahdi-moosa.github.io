# LaTeX Editors

## Motivation
After years of procastrinating, finally, I started document writing in [LaTeX :simple-latex:](https://www.latex-project.org). I have always been a fan of gorgeous documents prepared by LaTeX, but never got the time (a more apt pharsing would be - *never got over procastrinating*) to try out properly. 

## Tools
I have tried two approaches: 

* Using LaTeX Workshop extension in VS Code, link: [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
* Using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

## Feedbacks
Some feedback on these two approaches from my side:

* LaTeX Workshop in VS Code is *offline*, whereas overleaf is *online*. 
* Overleaf has no setup, LaTeX Workshop in VS Code requires setup/installation. I have used this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=triTgcyF_IA) to get LaTeX Workshop extension working in my VS Code.
* Overleaf is a *bit* easier (and more closer to [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors like MS Word or OpenOffice Writer) compared to using the VS Code extension.
* Suggestions are better in overleaf (perhaps this could be improved with other extensions in VS Code - *I haven't looked into it!*).

## Final recommendation

My final recommendations:

* If you want local/offline accessible LaTeX editor option (and you are already used to the VS Code interface), I think LaTeX Workshop extension in VS Code is an excillenet option.
* If you want something that just works (and keeping your document in the cloud doesn't matter for you), then overleaf is probably the easier option.

*Note: Keeping an offline option available to you is probably not a bad idea. I learned this the hard way, recently (news: [internet shutdown in Bangladesh](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/28/bangladesh-restores-mobile-internet-after-11-day-blackout-to-quell-protests))!*
